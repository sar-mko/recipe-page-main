### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- HTML Table

### What I learned

Learned a bit working on the table and how they work, and what designing them looks like. Took away border-spacing to match to the original image.

```css
table{
    width: 100%;
    border-spacing: 0;
    padding: 8px;
}
```

### Continued development

Want to try practicing grid, so will try re-building this project or similar ones with it.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - The MDN helped a lot with revisting pseudoclasses and sibling combinators to adding target styles for the table.
